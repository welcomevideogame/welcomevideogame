## About Me

I’m a Lead Platform Engineer with a background in backend engineering and systems work. Most of my day-to-day is spent building and maintaining internal platforms, shared services, and infrastructure that other teams depend on to ship and operate their software.

I’ve worked across application code, infrastructure, and tooling, which makes it easier for me to spot problems that show up later in production rather than just at design time. I tend to focus on making systems easier to run, easier to change, and easier to understand for the people who inherit them.

## What I Work On

In my current role, I lead work around platform architecture and backend foundations. That includes:
- Designing and evolving shared services
- Reviewing and challenging architectural decisions
- Improving deployment, observability, and operational workflows
- Acting as a point of contact when systems fail or behave in unexpected ways

I’m usually involved when something needs to scale beyond its original shape, or when a system has become hard to reason about and needs to be simplified rather than rewritten.

## Side Projects

Outside of work, I build small projects to explore ideas I don’t get to try in production. Lately, that’s been mostly Rust. I use it for services, internal tools, and experiments around concurrency and performance — less “hello world”, more “what breaks when this runs under load”.

These projects are mainly a way for me to stay sharp and test assumptions before I apply them at work.

## Open Source

I contribute to open-source projects when I run into something I use, understand, and can realistically improve. I’m more interested in fixing bugs, improving docs, or cleaning up rough edges than maintaining a large personal project for visibility.

## Contact

If you want to talk about backend systems, platform engineering, or why a particular piece of infrastructure keeps causing trouble, feel free to reach out.
